    This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

    This is fired after ending a conversation, when the replica has finished summarizing the visual artifacts that were detected throughout the call. This is a feature that is only available when the persona has `raven-0` specified in the [Perception Layer](/sections/conversational-video-interface/raven).
