    This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

    A `replica.started_speaking/stopped_speaking event` is broadcasted by Tavus at specific times: 

    conversation.replica.started_speaking means the replica has just started speaking.
    conversation.replica.stopped_speaking means the replica has just stopped speaking.

    These events are intended to act as triggers for actions within your application. For instance, you may want to
    start a video or show a slide at times related to when the replica started or stopped speaking.

    The inference_id can be used to correlate other events and tie things like conversation.utterance or tool_call
    together.
