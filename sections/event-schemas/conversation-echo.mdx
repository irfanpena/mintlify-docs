title: Echo Interaction
openapi-schema: echo
description: |
    This is an event developers may broadcast to Tavus.

    By broadcasting this event, you are able to tell the replica what to exactly say. Anything that is passed in the `text` field will be spoken by the replica.
    
    This is commonly used in combination with the [Interrupt Interaction](/sections/event-schemas/conversation-interrupt).
