title: User Started/Stopped Speaking Event
openapi-schema: user 
description: |
    This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

    A `user.started_speaking/stopped_speaking event` is broadcasted by Tavus at specific times: 

    conversation.user.started_speaking means the user has just started speaking.
    conversation.user.stopped_speaking means the user has just stopped speaking.

    These events are intended to act as triggers for actions within your application. For instance, you may want to
    take some user facing action, or backend process at times related to when the user started or stopped speaking.

    The inference_id can be used to correlate other events and tie things like conversation.utterance or tool_call
    together. 

    Keep in mind that with speculative_inference, the inference_id will frequently change while the user is speaking so
    that the user.started_speaking inference_id will not usually match the conversation.utterance inference_id
