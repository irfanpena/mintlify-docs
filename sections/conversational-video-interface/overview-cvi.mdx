Conversational Video Interface (CVI) is a framework for creating real-time video interactions with AI. It enables AI agents to see, hear, and respond naturally, mirroring human conversation.

CVI consists of three core components:
- **Persona**: Defines the AI agent’s behavior, tone, knowledge, and capabilities. Shaping how it responds during a conversation.
- **Replica**: Renders the AI agent’s visual appearance, with facial animations synced to speech for a lifelike presence using the Phoenix-3 model.
- **Conversation**: A real-time video call session where users interact with the AI agent powered by the configured persona and replica.

## Key Features

- **API-First Design**: Quickly build and test AI video conversations using our easy-to-integrate API.
- **Modular Pipeline**: Works with your existing LLMs, RAG, and TTS, giving you full control over identity, responses, and knowledge.
- **Easy Deployment and Scaling**: Run AI conversations at any scale. No need to worry about GPUs, traffic limits, or complex backend setup.
- **World’s Lowest Latency**: Achieve ~600ms utterance-to-utterance latency response time for fast, natural conversations with accurate turn-taking.
- **Multilingual Support**: CVI supports over 30 languages.
- **Lifelike AI Replicas**: Choose from 100+ lifelike stock replicas or create custom digital twins that look and sound human.

## Layers
CVI has a modular design made of different layers, which you can customize to fit your needs:
- **Transport (WebRTC)**: Handles video conferencing with built-in UI (using Daily by default). Customizable.
- **Perception**: Analyzes user’s facial and physical cues using the Raven model.
- **STT**: Manages conversation flow, interruptions, and pauses using the Hummingbird model.
- **LLM**: Responds to user input using Tavus or custom third-party models.
- **TTS**: Converts LLM response to speech.
- **STS**: Directly converts input speech to output speech, bypassing LLM and TTS.

## Customization Options
CVI offers extensive customization to tailor the AI experience:
- Bring your own LLM or enable function calling with Tavus-optimized models.
- Custom text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition components.
- Configure smart turn detection and adjust sensitivity for interruptions and pauses.
- Access video streams directly and build your own custom UI.
