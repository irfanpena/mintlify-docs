description: Learn how to configure the perception layer with Raven.
---

The **Perception Layer** in Tavus enhances AI agent with real-time visual understanding.
By using [**Raven**](/sections/models#raven%3A-perception-model), the AI agent becomes more context-aware, responsive, and capable of triggering actions based on visual input.

## Configuring the Perception Layer
To configure the Perception Layer, define the following parameters within the `layers.perception` object:
### 1. `perception_model`
Specifies the perception model to use.
- **Options**:
  - `raven-0` (default and recommended): Advanced visual capabilities, including screen share support, ambient queries, and perception tools.
  - `basic`: Legacy model with limited features.
  - `off`: Disables the perception layer.
<Note>
**Screen Share Feature**:When using `raven-0`, screen share feature is enabled by default without additional configuration.
</Note>

```json
"layers": {
  "perception": {
    "perception_model": "raven-0"
  }
}
```

### 2. `ambient_awareness_queries`
An array of custom queries that `raven-0` continuously monitors in the visual stream.
<Tip>
Best practices for custom queries:
- Use simple, focused prompts.
- Use queries that support your persona’s purpose.
</Tip>
```json
"ambient_awareness_queries": [
  "Is the user wearing a bright outfit?"
]
```

### 3. `perception_tool_prompt`

Tell `raven-0` when and how to trigger tools based on what it sees.
```json
"perception_tool_prompt":
  "You have a tool to notify the system when a bright outfit is detected, named `notify_if_bright_outfit_shown`. You MUST use this tool when a bright outfit is detected."
```

### 4. `perception_tools`
Defines callable functions that `raven-0` can trigger upon detecting specific visual conditions. Each tool must include a `type` and a `function` object detailing its schema.

```json
"perception_tools": [
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "notify_if_bright_outfit_shown",
      "description": "Use this function when a bright outfit is detected in the image with high confidence",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "outfit_color": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Best guess on what color of outfit it is"
          }
        },
        "required": ["outfit_color"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

<Note>
Please see [Tool/Function Calling](#) for more details.

### End-of-call Perception Analysis

`raven-0` generates a visual summary at the end of a call. This summary includes all detected visual artifacts and can be sent as:

- A [Perception Analysis](https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-perception-analysis) event

- A [conversation callback](https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/conversation-callbacks) (if specified)
<Note>
This feature is exclusive to personas with `raven-0` specified in the Perception Layer.
</Note>
## Example Use Case
This example demonstrates a persona designed to identify when a user wears a bright outfit and triggers an internal action accordingly.

```json
{
  "persona_name": "Fashion Advisor",
  "system_prompt": "As a Fashion Advisor, you specialize in offering tailored fashion advice.",
  "pipeline_mode": "full",
  "context": "You're having a video conversation with a client about their outfit.",
  "default_replica_id": "r79e1c033f",
  "layers": {
    "perception": {
      "perception_model": "raven-0",
      "ambient_awareness_queries": [
        "Is the user wearing a bright outfit?"
      ],
      "perception_tool_prompt": "You have a tool to notify the system when a bright outfit is detected, named `notify_if_bright_outfit_shown`. You MUST use this tool when a bright outfit is detected.",
      "perception_tools": [
        {
          "type": "function",
          "function": {
            "name": "notify_if_bright_outfit_shown",
            "description": "Use this function when a bright outfit is detected in the image with high confidence",
            "parameters": {
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {
                "outfit_color": {
                  "type": "string",
                  "description": "Best guess on what color of outfit it is"
                }
              },
              "required": ["outfit_color"]
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
