The **Perception Layer** in Tavus enhances AI personas with real-time visual understanding through webcam and screen share feeds. It enables the AI to track visual cues, assess user behavior, and trigger actions that allow for natural and deeply human interactions.

## Models Overview
Tavus offers two perception models:
- `raven-0`: Tavus’s advanced real-time multimodal perception model that provides human-like visual and emotional understanding. It’s context-aware, fast, and deeply customizable.
- `basic`: A lightweight legacy model with limited functionality.

**Perception Model Comparison**

| Feature                       | `raven-0` | `basic` |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Screen share support          | ✅       | ❌     |
| Custom visual queries         | ✅       | ❌     |
| Visual-triggered tool calling | ✅       | ❌     |
| Post-call video analysis      | ✅       | ❌     |

## Configuring the Perception Layer

### 1. Select the `perception_model`

`raven-0` is the default and recommended model for the Perception Layer. You can use it as is or customize it further to suit your needs.

<Note>
When you select the `raven-0` model, the screen sharing feature is automatically enabled by default. No additional configuration is required.
</Note>

```json
"layers": {
  "perception": {
    "perception_model": "raven-0"
  }
}
```

### 2. Add `ambient_awareness_queries`

Use this field to define passive visual prompts `raven-0` should always look for.
<Note>
This field is specifically for `raven-0`.
</Note>
```json
"ambient_awareness_queries": [
  "Is the user wearing a bright outfit?"
]
```

<Tip>
Use this to make the AI continuously aware of visual context without needing user input.
</Tip>

### 3. Define the `perception_tool_prompt`

Tell `raven-0` when and how to trigger tools based on what it sees.
<Note>
This field is specifically for `raven-0`.
</Note>
```json
"perception_tool_prompt":
  "You have a tool to notify the system when a bright outfit is detected, named `notify_if_bright_outfit_shown`. You MUST use this tool when a bright outfit is detected."
```

### 4. Register `perception_tools`

These are callable functions that can be triggered by `raven-0` when specific visual conditions are met.
<Note>
This field is specifically for `raven-0`.
</Note>
```json
"perception_tools": [
  {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
      "name": "notify_if_bright_outfit_shown",
      "description": "Use this function when a bright outfit is detected in the image with high confidence",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "outfit_color": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Best guess on what color of outfit it is"
          }
        },
        "required": ["outfit_color"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

<Note>
Perception tools require both a `type` and detailed `parameters` schema.
</Note>

### End-of-call Perception Analysis

If your persona uses `raven-0`, it will automatically generate a visual summary at the end of a call. This summary includes all detected visual artifacts and can be sent as:

- A [Perception Analysis](https://docs.tavus.io/sections/event-schemas/conversation-perception-analysis) event

- A [conversation callback](https://docs.tavus.io/sections/conversational-video-interface/conversation-callbacks) (if specified)

## Example Use Case

This persona identifies when a user is wearing a bright outfit and triggers an internal action.
<Tip>
**Recommendation:**

Use the full **CVI end-to-end pipeline** for optimal performance and lowest latency.

### Behavioral Flow

- **Visual Detection**: `raven-0` monitors for defined visual queries (e.g., bright outfit).

- **Tool Prompting**: Guides the AI to act using perception tools.

- **Tool Execution**: Invokes tools (e.g., `notify_if_bright_outfit_shown`) with context-specific parameters.
