A conversation is a video call session with a replica.

When a conversation is created, Tavus provides a meeting URL with a Daily prebuilt video interface. The replica automatically joins the call and begins interacting.

## Conversation Customizations
Tavus provides several customizations that you can set per conversation:
### Identity and Context Setup
- **Persona**: You can use a stock persona provided by Tavus or create a custom one. If no replica is specified, the default replica linked to the persona will be used (if available).
- **Replica**: Use a stock replica provided by Tavus or create a custom one. If a replica is provided without a persona, the default Tavus persona will be used.
- **Conversation Context**: Customize the conversation context to set the scene, explain the user’s role, say who joins the call, or point out key topics. It builds on the base persona and helps the AI give better, more focused answers.
- **Custom Greeting**: You can personalize the opening line that the AI should use when the conversation starts.
### Advanced Settings and Features
- **Call Time Settings**: Set call durations and timeouts to control usage, avoid extra costs, and ensure users stay within their allotted time and concurrency limits.
- **Language**: Set the supported language your conversation speaks in. If you're using a custom TTS voice, make sure it supports the selected language.
- **Background Customization**: Set the AI agent’s background to a green screen or use WebGL on the frontend to make it transparent or replace it with a custom background.
   - You can use WebGL on the frontend to make the green screen transparent or change its color. Try it out with our [CVI Green Screen Sample App](https://andy-tavus.github.io/CVI-greenscreen-webGL/).
- **Subtitles**: Enable subtitles for your conversation.
- **Call Recording**: Enable the recording feature and set up your own S3 bucket to store the conversation recording.
