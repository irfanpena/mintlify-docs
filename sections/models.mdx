## Phoenix: Replica Rendering Model
Phoenix-3 is Tavus' top model for replica creation. It creates realistic digital versions of people that can show emotions, blink, and move naturally. Phoenix-3 uses a type of AI called Gaussian diffusion to track tiny facial movements like blinks and expressions in real time.

**Key Features**:
- **Full-Face Animation**: Generates synchronized facial expressions, including subtle movements.
- **High Fidelity**: Maintains natural identity preservation and consistent lip sync.
- **Emotionally Driven**: Adjusts expressions based on context, tone, and conversational cues.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Delivers high-quality resolution for natural interactions.
