#### Conversations and Personas

- Each **conversation** is a unique video interaction between a user and a [replica](/sections/replicas/overview), complete with its own ID. The replica can handle video generation and [live interactions](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation) without extra training.

- Upon creating a conversation, you’ll get a `conversation_url` to share with users. If you include a `callback_url`, you'll receive notifications on status changes, such as when the replica joins.

- You can enhance conversations by adding a [**persona**](/api-reference/personas/create-persona), which customizes the replica's behavior with a `system_prompt`. The same persona can be used across multiple replicas.

- Include `conversational_context` to provide specific details about the participant or situation, grounding the replica in the current moment.

- If no persona is added, the conversation will default to a general persona.

- You can customize the language of the conversation by providing the `language` parameter in the `properties` object. Please see the [language parameter](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation#language) for more information.
