        Create and customize a digital replica's personality for Conversational Video Interface (CVI). A persona defines the replica's behavior and capabilities through configurable layers including:

        **Core Components:**
        - Replica - Choice of audio/visual appearance 
        - Context - Customizable contextual information, for use by LLM 
        - System Prompt - Customizable system prompt, for use by LLM
        - Layers
          - STT - Transcription, turn taking, and Sparrow-0 settings 
          - LLM - Language model settings 
          - TTS - Text-to-Speech settings
          {/*- STS - Speech-to-Speech settings*/}
          - Perception - Multimodal vision and understanding settings (Raven-0)

        When creating a conversation, the persona configuration determines how the replica interacts, processes information, and responds to participants. Each layer can be fine-tuned to achieve the desired conversational experience.
