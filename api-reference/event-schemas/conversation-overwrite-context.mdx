title: Overwrite Conversational Context
openapi-schema: overwrite_ll_context
description: |
  This is an event developers may broadcast to Tavus.

  By broadcasting this event, you are able to overwrite the `conversational_context` that the replica uses to generate responses. 
  
  If `conversational_context` was not provided during conversation creation, the replica will start using the `context` you provide in this event as `conversational_context`.
  
  Learn more about the `conversational_context`: [Create Conversation](/api-reference/conversations/create-conversation)
