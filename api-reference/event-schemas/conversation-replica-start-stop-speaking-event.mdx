description: |
    This is an event broadcasted by Tavus.

    A `replica.started_speaking/stopped_speaking event` is broadcasted by Tavus at specific times: the replica.started_speaking is
    sent when the replica begins speaking, and a separate event for the replica.stopped_speaking is also sent as the
    replica stop speaking. 

    Replica.started/stopped_speaking events can be used to keep track of when the replica has started or stopped
    speaking.

    The inference_id can be used to correlate other events with these replica.[started|stopped]_speaking events, so you
    can know what and when the replica said something.
